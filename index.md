Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

We work so hard to lay a great project in your feet 



**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```



### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/AlperPaydak/matematikprojesi.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
